== Welcome to sshGate

sshGate is a tool which helps to configure an OpenSSH server in order to have
a SSH proxy. sshGate uses the double SSH method to be able to connect to
a target host. In fact, sshGate has private ssh-keys of target hosts, makes
ACL checks and can log what users do on a given target host.

                        /-------> target host N
                       /-------->     . . .
         user ----> sshGate ----> target host 1
                      |-> ACL
                      |-> private sshkeys
