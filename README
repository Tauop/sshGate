== Welcome to sshGate

sshGate is a tool which helps to configure an OpenSSH server in order to have
a SSH proxy. sshGate uses the double SSH method to be able to connect to
a target host. In fact, sshGate has private ssh-keys of target hosts, makes
ACL checks and can log what users do on a given target host.

                        /-------> target host N
                       /-------->     . . .
         user ----> sshGate ----> target host 1
                      |-> ACL
                      |-> private sshkeys

  git clone git://github.com/Tauop/sshGate.git
  cd sshGate

Then, init and update Git submodule (to download ScriptHelper)
  git submodule init && git submodule update

To build tarball package(s), use the build.sh script (specify a version number)
  ./build.sh        # build server and client
  ./build.sh client # build the client
  ./build.sh server # build the server

To install built package(s), just untar .tar.gz, go to the created directory and run install.sh.
