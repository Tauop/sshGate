config-sshgate.sh will help the user to update his ~/.ssh/config to
setup a "sshgate" host, which will be used by 'sshg' and 'scpg' script.

'sshg' and 'scpg' scripts may be put into the /usr/local/bin/ directory.

== Install ==

Just run the install.sh script and answer to questions.

Be careful, some answer depends on the sshGate server installation/configuration.
See your admins for more information

== Details ==

'sshg' is quite simple. It's an equivalent of 'ssh sshgate <target_host> <cmd>'

'scpg' is more complex. Here are the 'scpg - scp' equivalent syntaxes:

in send mode:
  scpg [<options>] <file1> <file2> <target_host>:<target_location>
 --> scp [<options>] <file1> <file2> sshgate:<target_host>/<target_location>

in receive mode:
  scpg [<options>] <target_host>:<target_location> <local_location>
 --> scp [<options] sshgate:<target_host>/<target_location> <local_location>
