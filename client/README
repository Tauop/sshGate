== README ==

sshgate-client-configure help the user to update his ~/.ssh/config to
setup a "sshgate" host, which will be used by 'sshg' and 'scpg' script.

'sshg' and 'scpg' scripts may be put into the /usr/local/bin/ directory.

NOTICE : sshgate-client-configure depends on ScriptHelper (http://github.com/Tauop/ScriptHelper)

== Install ==

Copy sshg, scpg and sshgate-client-configure in /usr/local/bin/ and put execution rights on them

First time you will run scpg or sshg, or if Host sshgate isn't configured in ~/.ssh/config,
sshgate-client-configure will ask questions to configure sshg and scpg. Be careful, some answer
depends on the sshGate server installation/configuration. Ask your admins for more information

If your sshGate server has changed, you will be able to change sshg and scpg configuration
by calling sshgate-client-configure

== Details ==

'sshgate-client-configure' ask questions and write into ~/.ssh/config.

'sshg' is quite simple. It's an equivalent of 'ssh sshgate <target_host> <cmd>'

'scpg' is more complex. Here are the 'scpg - scp' equivalent syntaxes:

in send mode:
  scpg [<options>] <file1> <file2> <target_host>:<target_location>
 --> scp [<options>] <file1> <file2> sshgate:<target_host>/<target_location>

in receive mode:
  scpg [<options>] <target_host>:<target_location> <local_location>
 --> scp [<options] sshgate:<target_host>/<target_location> <local_location>
